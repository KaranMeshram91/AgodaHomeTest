# AgodaHomeTest

1) This project is created using IntelliJ IDE in Java programming language

2) There are two main classes for changePassword functionlity under com.changepassword.service package where the core business logic is written

-EditDistance - to find the match in between old and new password
-PasswordChanger - This has the core logic for password validations as per the requirement

3) I have used log4j for logging purpose
The log4j xml is provided in the resources folder - log4j2.xml

In the log4j2.xml , fileName should be updated by user as per system {path to the logger}/change-password.log
This is the location where the framework log file will be generated apart from console logging

4) I have kept console logging for simple debugging which can be removed as we centralized logger as metioned in #4.

5) I have used TestNG for the automated testing of the test cases 
a. TestNG.xml file is in the TestPasswords folder which is the project parent directory
b. All the automated test cases are in ChangePasswordTest class which is in test package

6) I have integrated the Extent report to see the test results as an html file in browser post automated test execution.
This html report gets generated in the ExtentReports folder upon running the automted tests from TestNG.xml file as mentioned in #5
The Extent report is generated by the name : ExtentReportResults.html

To support Extent reporting we have added some util classes under utils.ExtentReports
a. ExtentManager class - here you can define the location where the report html should be generaterd
b. ExtentTestManager class 

7) Testlistner class under Listners Package is used by TestNG to print the start,End and other activites of test cases whenever an automated test runs

8) Data driven test cases are also supported using data providers in TestNG
This will help to read list of new passwords from CSV file 
All the passwords read from CSV file will be executed by the test case till the end of CSV file

To support that we have created under utils.csvReader package CSVDataProvider class that reads all the test data from test cases.
We have used the same in test cases like (SQL injection, Cross site scripting and Dangerous linux commands) being passed as new password

9) Test.Resources folder has the .csv files for 
SQL injection string
Cross site scripting strings
Dangerous linux commands

This is used by data providers

10) We have used maven build tools for fetching external dependencies under pom.xml file

#Steps to run from IDE :
1) git clone the project'
2) Open the TestPasswords project in IntelliJ IDE
3) Open the TestNG.xml file
4) Right click and run the TestNG.xml file

This will execute all the test cases automated in ChangePasswordTest class under package tests.ChangePasswordTest

#To run individual test cases
1) go to ChangePasswordTest class under package tests.ChangePasswordTest
2) right click on the test method you wish to execute that has @Test annotation
3) Click run for that test method name

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Steps to add a new Automated test case
1) go to ChangePasswordTest class under package tests.ChangePasswordTest
2) At the end of the file
add

@Test(priority = 0, description = {give a suitable test description}")
    public void testCaseMethodName(Method method) {
        //ExtentReports Description
        ExtentTestManager.startTest(method.getName(), "{give a suitable test description}");
        Assert.assertEquals(PasswordChanger.changePassword("<{give old password}", "{give new password}"),{give boolen aasertion : true/false});
    }
